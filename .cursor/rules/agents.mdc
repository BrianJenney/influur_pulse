# Agent Development Guidelines

## Architecture

- Follow Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Each agent should do one thing well
- Compose agents for complex tasks
- Use agent chaining for multi-step processes

## Performance & Cost

- Use `gpt-4o-mini` for simple tasks
- Reserve `gpt-4o` for complex reasoning
- System prompts can be cached - so avoid dynamic system prompts (don't use string interpolation basically)

## Type Safety

- Use `zodResponseFormat` for structured outputs
- Define schemas in `/lib/schemas`
- Validate inputs and outputs
- Use TypeScript for type safety

## Prompt Engineering

- Include examples in prompts
- Ask for reasoning to improve results
- Use markdown formatting
